# Spectogram Output Directory

This directory contains generated spectrogram images converted from the audio dataset.

## Contents
- **.png files**: Spectrogram representations of the audio tracks.
- **Note**: The actual image files are ignored by git to save space. Only this README is tracked.

## Usage
Run the `audio_to_spectogram.py` script to populate this directory:
```bash
python AudioToSpectogram/audio_to_spectogram.py
```
