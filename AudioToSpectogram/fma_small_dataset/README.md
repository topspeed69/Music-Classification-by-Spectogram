# FMA Small Dataset

This directory is intended to hold the FMA (Free Music Archive) Small dataset.

## Contents
- **.mp3 files**: The raw audio tracks for the dataset.
- **Note**: The audio files are ignored by git due to size constraints.

## Setup
1. Download the `fma_small.zip` from the [FMA dataset repository](https://github.com/mdeff/fma).
2. Extract the contents into this directory.
3. Ensure the structure matches what the scripts expect (e.g., `000/000002.mp3`).
